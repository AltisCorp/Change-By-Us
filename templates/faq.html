            <h3>Question about logging into the site?</h3>
              <p>New Yorkers have always been full of great ideas about what will improve their 	neighborhoods.   Use {{ d.config.site.name }} to broadcast to others what you have in mind.  No idea is too big.  No idea is too small.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
            <h3>Question about doing something else on the site like creating a project or something?</h3>
            <p>Look for projects in your neighborhood or around the city where you can help.  Become a member and plug into a network of those who want what you want! You can also use {{ d.config.site.name }} to set up and lead your own project, and turn your idea into reality.</p>
